### **Project Requirements**

1. **Users**:

    - Users of the app are hotel employees who must be logged in to perform tasks.
    - New users can only be signed up inside the application to ensure only actual hotel employees have accounts.

2. **Profile Management**:

    - Users should be able to upload an avatar and change their name and password.

3. **Cabin Management**:

    - The app needs a table view showing all cabins with details like cabin photo, name, capacity, price, and current discount.
    - Users should be able to update or delete a cabin and create new cabins (including uploading a photo).

4. **Booking Management**:

    - The app needs a table view showing all bookings with arrival and departure dates, status, paid amount, cabin data, and guest data.
    - Booking statuses include "unconfirmed," "checked in," and "checked out." The table should be filterable by status.
    - Other booking data includes: number of guests, number of nights, guest observations, breakfast booking, and breakfast price.
    - Users should be able to delete, check in, or check out a booking as the guest arrives.
    - Bookings may not have been paid yet on guest arrival. On check-in, users need to accept payment (outside the app) and then confirm payment received (inside the app).
    - Guests should have the ability to add breakfast for the entire stay during check-in if they hadn't already booked it.

5. **Dashboard**:

    - Display a list of guests checking in and out on the current day.
    - Show statistics on recent bookings, sales, check-ins, and occupancy rates.
    - Include charts for daily hotel sales (total and extras) and stay durations.

6. **Settings**:

    - Allow users to define application-wide settings such as breakfast price, minimum/maximum nights per booking, and maximum guests per booking.

7. **Dark Mode**:
    - Implement a dark mode for better usability.
